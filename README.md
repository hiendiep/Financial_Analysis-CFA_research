## 4. Timeline

**Start to End: Sep 2023 - Jan 2024

## 5. Scope of Work

- Conduct a comprehensive equity valuation of Digiworld Corporation (DGW) using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and market analysis to determine its intrinsic value and investment potential.
- Analyze DGW’s competitive positioning in the ICT and consumer discretionary sectors, focusing on market share, distribution capabilities, and segment performance (e.g., smartphones, laptops, office equipment, home appliances, consumer goods).
- Provide insights into DGW’s governance, shareholder structure, and employee metrics to assess operational sustainability and growth drivers.

## 6. Process and Approach

**Input:**
- Company visit
- Financial data (e.g., DGW’s financial statements, HOSE data)
- Industry reports (e.g., market share data for smartphones and laptops, ICT distribution trends)
- Company-specific data (e.g., governance structure, shareholder details, employee metrics)

**Output:**

- Valuation analysis (DCF with FCFF and WACC calculation)
- Competitive positioning assessment
- Investment recommendation based on intrinsic value and upside potential
- Presentation to the judge

**Process and Features:**

- **Industry Analysis:** Assess DGW’s market share in the ICT sector (e.g., smartphones and laptops, as shown in Fig 10 and Fig 11) and trends in consumer discretionary segments like home appliances and consumer goods (Appendix 17-19), identifying growth opportunities in Vietnam’s retail market (e.g., 67% general trade, 26% modern trade).
- **Valuation Modeling:** Perform a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation using Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 12.24%, calculating an enterprise value of 9,861 billion VND and an equity intrinsic value of 9,390 billion VND, with a fair value per share of 90,600 VND (Appendix 20-22).
- **Competitive Analysis:** Evaluate DGW’s ICT distribution capabilities against competitors, focusing on metrics like points of sale (POS), service centers, and segment diversification (e.g., office equipment, home appliances), as shown in Appendix 13.
- **Sustainability Assessment:** Analyze DGW’s governance structure, shareholder composition, employee income, turnover rate, and gender diversity (Fig 15-19) to evaluate operational stability and long-term growth potential.

## 7. Outcome

- DGW’s intrinsic value is calculated at 90,600 VND per share, compared to the current price of 51,500 VND, indicating a significant upside potential (approximately 76%).
- DGW is well-positioned in the ICT distribution sector with strong capabilities in smartphones and laptops, but faces challenges in diversifying into non-ICT segments like consumer goods due to competitive retail market dynamics (Appendix 18-19).
- The company’s governance and employee metrics suggest operational stability, though high turnover rates (Fig 18-19) may pose risks to long-term growth.

## 8. My Role

**Team Member, Financial Analyst**

- Analyze DGW’s market position in the ICT and consumer discretionary sectors, focusing on smartphones, laptops, and distribution capabilities.

## 9. Lessons Learned

- Deep understanding of equity valuation techniques (DCF, FCFF, WACC) and their application in investment analysis.
- Insights into Vietnam’s ICT and consumer discretionary market dynamics, including distribution challenges and retail trade trends.
- Practical skills in assessing competitive positioning and operational sustainability using governance, employee, and market data.
